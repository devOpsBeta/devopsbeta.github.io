Screen is a tool to save terminal session for when you have long running jobs or have an unreliable connection or just need to log off. The main alternate to this is tmux which I will put another article on in the future. 

```
# create session
screen 

# create named session
screen -S <sessName>

# list screen sections
screen -ls

# reconnect to a unnamed session
screen -r <enoughSessionIDNumberToBeUnique>

# reconnect to named session
screen -xS <sessName>

# to disconnect
ctrl+a then d 

# to scroll output of screen session
ctrl+a then esc 

```
