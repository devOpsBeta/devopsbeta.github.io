## Overview
 This app allows you to add jobs to task spool that automatically puts the task in the background saving the output from the cmd in /tmp folder.



## installation:
```
yum groupinstall "Development tools"
wget https://vicerveza.homeunix.net/~viric/soft/ts/ts-1.0.tar.gz
tar xf ts-1.0.tar.gz
cd ts-1.0
make && make install
```
## usage:
```
# to view status of task/cmd in queue
ts

# to schedule a task/cmd
ts <cmd>

## will start yum update in the job queue
ts yum -y update


# to view output of task/cmd in queue - get task id from `ts`
ts <taskID>



## to add additional queue - append TS_SOCKET env in front of all usages
TS_SOCKET=/tmp/devtask ts echo "<'_'>"
```
If you want to save time in managing multiple queue

It may be a good idea to setup alias for TS_SOCKET path to save time managing task in different queues.
