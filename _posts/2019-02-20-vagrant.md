Vagrant builds and manages VM environment which allows multi vms to be configured at once and then destroyed and recreated again before you can manually setup one vm.

Vagrant uses already configured images to deploy thus speeding up deployment time.You have the option to make your own box but there are loads of pre-made images that are regularly updated.

Vagrant interfaces with providers (Docker/VirtualBox/hyperv) and allows provisioning tools(Chef, Puppet, Ansible, shell scripts) to be ran when the Vm is created.

Other custom plugins can be used to allow additional providers to be used.

Basic Commands

```
# initializes current directory as vagrant environment (creates Vagrantfile)
vagrant init

# create and configs VM
vagrant up

# halts VM
vagrant halt

# destroys VM
vagrant destroy

# validate Vagrantfile
vagrant validate

# runs configured provisioners
vagrant provision

# status
vagrant status

### ssh into vagrant vm
vagrant ssh
# or the equivalent ssh  
ssh vagrant@localhost -p2222 -i ~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key  # vagrant is the password

### ssh config of vagrant
vagrant ssh-config

```
